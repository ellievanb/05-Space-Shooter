# 05-Space-Shooter

In this assignment I created a basic space shooter game. In it you, the player, are a red space ship trying to kill 5 enemy green space ships. By clicking at them and shooting them enough times, you will be able to kill them all and end the game. However, they are also shooting back at you! Use the mouse to move left and right and dodge their bullets. Good luck!
